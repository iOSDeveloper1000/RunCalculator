# RunCalculator

A SIMPLE TOOL FOR QUICKLY EVALUATING RUN TIMES AND DISTANCES.


## App specification

For any endurance sport the app can be used to **store the measured time and distance** and compare it with former values. Thereby, you can get a quick overview of your **current personal level of training**.


## Features

### Key features

* Store your personal _run times and distances_.

* Calculate _average speed_ and convert it quickly to _different units_ (e.g. _min/km_).

* List the _best runs_ - for a certain distance or for any distance sorted by average speed.

* Plot all your runs in a _two-dimensional distance-speed-graph_ to see your current level of training in terms of speed and endurance. (_added in follow-up version of app_)


### Supporting features


* Group your data by _user definable sports_.

* Import and export your data in zip format.
